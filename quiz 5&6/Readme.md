# Statistical Modeling and Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to a series of statistical modeling tasks designed to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of different predictive models. Each model is used to predict outcomes based on the provided dataset.

## Models Covered
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Predicts outcomes using a single predictor variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extends predictions to multiple predictor variables.
- **Regression Tree Model**: Uses decision tree algorithms for regression tasks.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applies logistic regression for binary outcome prediction.
- **Decision Tree Classification**: Employs decision trees for classification purposes.

## Dataset
The `mobile phone price prediction.csv` file serves as the dataset for all tasks. It includes various features used to predict mobile phone pricing tiers.
