# Project Overview: Data Analysis and Visualization

## Introduction
This project, encapsulated in the Jupyter notebook "Quiz_1", focuses on data analysis and visualization. It leverages Python and its powerful libraries to process, analyze, and visualize data, potentially related to demographics, employment, or economic studies.

## Contents
1. **Importing Libraries**: Essential Python libraries are imported for data handling and visualization. Common libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for plotting graphs are used.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The notebook includes processes for loading data from sources and preparing it for analysis. This step involves cleaning the data and formatting it into a structured format for ease of use in subsequent analyses.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: The core of the project lies in this section, where data is analyzed, and results are visualized. This includes the creation of plots and charts to draw meaningful insights from the data.

4. **Specific Analyses**: 
    - An example analysis provided is the visualization of average salaries across different age groups using a line plot. 
    - X-axis: Age Group 
    - Y-axis: Average Salary in USD
